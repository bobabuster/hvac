<h2> Data Structures and Structure </h2>

I created three unit classes: a brand, model line, and model variant class. A brand instance will store the brand name and list of mode lines. The model line shows its model line and list of variants. The model variant shows which variant it is, and a link to the user manual.
This structure preserves how the webpage is structured in that the client will first select the brand, then will be taken to a page showing the model lines, then the variants, and finally a link to the user manual.
I obtained the data from real hvac manufacturers like Goodman and Carrier, and chose a set of appliances like refrigerators and furnaces, and looked up the manual associated with each of those products

<h2> Setup Instruction </h2>
I deployed the application on Render, so clicking the link https://hvac-dla8.onrender.com should take you to the website.

For local testing and deployment, Node.js was used to run the application on a local host server.
The backend was set up with Java and Spring Boot. Maven was used to install the dependencies. frontend was written with JavaScript, React, and run with Node
